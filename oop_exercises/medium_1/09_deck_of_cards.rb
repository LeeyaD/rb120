# Using the Card class from the previous exercise, create a Deck class that contains all of the standard 52 playing cards. Use the following code to start your work:
class Deck
  RANKS = ((2..10).to_a + %w(Jack Queen King Ace)).freeze
  SUITS = %w(Hearts Clubs Diamonds Spades).freeze
end

# The Deck class should provide a #draw method to deal one card. The Deck should be shuffled when it is initialized and, if it runs out of cards, it should reset itself by generating a new set of 52 shuffled cards.

# Examples:
deck = Deck.new
drawn = []
52.times { drawn << deck.draw }
drawn.count { |card| card.rank == 5 } == 4
drawn.count { |card| card.suit == 'Hearts' } == 13

drawn2 = []
52.times { drawn2 << deck.draw }
drawn != drawn2 # Almost always.

# Note that the last line should almost always be true; if you shuffle the deck 1000 times a second, you will be very, very, very old before you see two consecutive shuffles produce the same results. If you get a false result, you almost certainly have something wrong.
