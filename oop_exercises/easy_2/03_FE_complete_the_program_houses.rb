# Is the technique we employ here to make House objects comparable a good one? (Hint: is there a natural way to compare Houses? Is price the only criteria you might use?) 
# since the output was re money 'cheaper'/'expensice' the technique we used is a good one.
# a more natural way??? None that I can think of...

# What problems might you run into, if any? Can you think of any sort of classes where including Comparable is a good idea?
# We'll run into problems if we want to compare Houses based on other attributes...
# Classes that have one data type 'string', 'integer' but not the possibility of both
