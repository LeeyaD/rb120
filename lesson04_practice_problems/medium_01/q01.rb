# Ben asked Alyssa to code review the following code:
class BankAccount
  attr_reader :balance

  def initialize(starting_balance)
    @balance = starting_balance
  end

  def positive_balance?
    balance >= 0
  end
end
# Alyssa glanced over the code quickly and said - "It looks fine, except that you forgot to put the @ before balance when you refer to the balance instance variable in the body of the positive_balance? method."

# "Not so fast", Ben replied. "What I'm doing here is valid - I'm not missing an @!"

# Who is right, Ben or Alyssa, and why?
# A: Ben is right because we have an attr_reader which gives us our getter method, which returns the data store in our instance variable. No need to reference it directly!
