# Keeping Score
# Right now, the game doesn't have very much dramatic flair. It'll be more interesting if we were playing up to, say, 10 points. Whoever reaches 10 points first wins. Can you build this functionality? We have a new noun -- a score. Is that a new class, or a state of an existing class? You can explore both options and see which one works better.

# 1. Write a textual description of the program or exercise.


# 2. Extract the major nouns and verbs from the description.


# 3. Organize and associate the verbs with the nouns (nouns -> classes | verbs -> methods)


# 4. Do a spike to explore the problem w/ temporary code


# 5. When you have a better idea of the problem, model thoughts into CRC Cards (optional)
